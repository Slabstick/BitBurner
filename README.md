# BitBurner
All my Bitburner Scripts

It might be a game, but it's a neat way to learn JavaScript, how to work with other scripts and how to implement different API's into ones own code. And probably even more, as I only scratched the surface.
This is just a place to drop all my scripts and document my progress of learning to code.

From https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner:
Bitburner is a programming-based incremental game that revolves around hacking and cyberpunk themes. The game can be played at https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner or installed through Steam.
